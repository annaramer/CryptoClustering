# Cryptocurrency Clustering with K-Means
## Overview
- This project clusters cryptocurrencies using K-Means. Key steps include data preparation, finding the optimal number of clusters (k), clustering, and visualization.

## Files
- Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
## Data Preparation:
- Loaded and explored the cryptocurrency data.
- Normalized the data using StandardScaler.
- Finding the Best Value for k:
- Utilized the elbow method to find the optimal k value.
## Clustering:
- Clustered cryptocurrencies using K-Means with the original data.
- Applied PCA to reduce features and clustered again.
## Visualization: 
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots.
## Impact of Feature Reduction:
- Analyzed the impact of using fewer features through PCA.

## Credits
- Completed by Anna Ramer.
